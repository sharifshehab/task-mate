# Task Mate

Task Mate is a Kanban-style board built with React, Express.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to manage tasks across three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. Users can add, edit, delete, and update tasks, as well as drag and drop tasks to reorder them within a column or move them between columns. Changes are instantly saved to the backend, ensuring data persistence even after a page refresh. The app features a clean and responsive design, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. State management is handled by React Query for efficient data fetching and caching. Enjoy managing your tasks efficiently with Task Mate!
